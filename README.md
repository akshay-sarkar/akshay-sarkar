With 9 years of experience in the digital realm, I've had my hands in web, cloud, and full-stack technologies :computer: . JavaScript is my jam, and I'm always exploring how tools like Augment and Continue.dev can boost my workflow. This is where I experiment, build cool stuff, and explore the vast world of tech, enhanced by AI.
